\title{Intersect Enrichment Results}
\usage{
intersect_enrichment(enr1, enr2)
}
\arguments{
\item{enr1}{A list of enrichment results, where each element is a data frame with enrichment terms.}

\item{enr2}{A list of enrichment results, where each element is a data frame with enrichment terms. Must be of the same length as `enr1`.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{enrichment_SameTrend}{A list of common enrichment terms between `enr1` and `enr2` for the same trend.}
  \item{enrichment_OppositeTrend}{If `opposite_trend` is `TRUE`, a list of common enrichment terms where the trend is opposite between `enr1` and `enr2`.}
}
If `opposite_trend` is `FALSE`, only `enrichment_SameTrend` is returned.
}
\description{
This function identifies common enrichment terms between two enrichment result lists, optionally accounting for opposite trends.
