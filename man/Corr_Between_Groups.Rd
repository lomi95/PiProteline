\usage{
Corr_Between_Groups(data.grouped, corr_groups = "spearman")
}
\arguments{
\item{data.grouped}{A list of data frames or matrices, where each element represents a group. Rows represent observations, and columns represent variables within each group.}

\item{corr_groups}{A character string specifying the type of correlation to compute. Options include "pearson", "spearman". Default is "spearman".}
}
\value{
A named list of correlation results for each pair of groups, where each element contains the correlation matrix and associated statistics (p-values, etc.).
}
\description{
This function computes the correlation between the means of different groups in a list of datasets. Each dataset represents a group, and pairwise correlations are computed for all possible combinations of groups.
}
\examples{
# Example datasets
group1 <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
group2 <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
group3 <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)

# Combine into a list
data.grouped <- list(Group1 = group1, Group2 = group2, Group3 = group3)

# Compute correlations between the groups
Corr_Between_Groups(data.grouped, corr_groups = "spearman")
